## 📋 Quick Eligibility Reality Check

Before diving into the planning process, let's ensure you're on the right track:

### ✅ Core Requirements Checklist
- [ ] **Job Offer**: From UK employer with valid sponsor licence
- [ ] **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)**: Provided by your employer
- [ ] **Eligible Role**: Position must be on the skilled occupation list
- [ ] **Salary Threshold**: Meet minimum £38,700 or going rate (whichever is higher)
- [ ] **English Proficiency**: B1 level minimum (CEFR equivalent)
- [ ] **Financial Requirements**: £1,270 available for 28 consecutive days
- [ ] **Clean Record**: No serious criminal convictions

### 🚨 Red Flags That Stop Applications
**STOP if any of these apply:**
- Your employer doesn't have a sponsor licence
- The job is below the minimum salary threshold
- You have recent criminal convictions
- You can't prove English language ability
- You don't have the required maintenance funds

**💡 Pro Tip**: 23% of applications fail on salary calculations alone. Our salary calculator (included in resources) prevents this costly mistake.

## ⚠️ The 7 Deadliest Visa Application Mistakes

### 1. **The Salary Miscalculation Trap**
**The Mistake**: Assuming annual salary meets requirements without checking hourly rates  
**The Reality**: Complex calculation involving hourly minimums, allowances, and going rates  
**The Fix**: Use official government calculator + verify with sponsor  
**Cost of Mistake**: £719 application fee + 6-month delay

### 2. **The Document Quality Disaster**
**The Mistake**: Submitting blurry scans, missing pages, or poor translations  
**The Reality**: Home Office has zero tolerance for unclear documents  
**The Fix**: High-resolution scans, certified translations, complete document sets  
**Cost of Mistake**: Automatic refusal + new application required

### 3. **The Financial Evidence Failure**
**The Mistake**: Bank statements that don't clearly show required funds for 28 days  
**The Reality**: Must show £1,270 continuously held, not just deposited  
**The Fix**: Plan 28-day fund demonstration period in advance  
**Cost of Mistake**: Immediate refusal + credibility damage

### 4. **The CoS Mismatch Catastrophe**
**The Mistake**: Application details don't exactly match Certificate of Sponsorship  
**The Reality**: Even minor discrepancies trigger automatic rejection  
**The Fix**: Triple-check every detail matches your CoS exactly  
**Cost of Mistake**: £719 fee lost + employer relationship strain

### 5. **The English Language Oversight**
**The Mistake**: Using expired test results or non-UKVI approved providers  
**The Reality**: Only specific tests from approved providers accepted  
**The Fix**: Verify test validity dates and provider approval status  
**Cost of Mistake**: £150-200 retest + application delay

### 6. **The Wrong Category Catastrophe**
**The Mistake**: Applying for Skilled Worker when another route is better  
**The Reality**: Each visa category has specific requirements and benefits  
**The Fix**: Professional assessment of best visa route for your situation  
**Cost of Mistake**: Refusal + missed opportunities in correct category

### 7. **The Incomplete Submission Slip**
**The Mistake**: Hitting submit before all sections properly completed  
**The Reality**: Incomplete applications cannot be corrected after submission  
**The Fix**: Use our completion checklist before final submission  
**Cost of Mistake**: Full application fee forfeiture + restart process
